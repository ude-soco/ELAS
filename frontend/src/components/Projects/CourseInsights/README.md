### Main Idea

1. Select from a variety of study programs from the Faculty of Engineering
2. Having an interactive interface to select and compare courses
3. Decide which courses to choose based on ratings and time compatibility

## Scraper

In collaboration with the LivewareProblem-Group, the [Scraper from the original CourseInsights-Project](https://github.com/FloRich/uni-due-course-catalog-scraper) got adapted to the needs of both our groups' new projects.

### How to run the Scraper

You can scrape new information from the LSF by opening `http://localhost:3000/scrape`, inserting the latest LSF link and clicking on the button "Start scraping".

## How to run

1. Download and install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/de/download/)
2. Rename `example.env` to `.env`
3. Run the project and install it locally using npm:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

4. Open `http://localhost:3000` to view it in the browser.
